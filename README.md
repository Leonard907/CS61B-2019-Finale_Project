# CS61B-2019-Finale_Project
Though I'm not a student in Berkeley (I wish I were), I took the liberty of studying 2019 CS61B materials and finished all the projects and homework. 
This is the final **LARGE** project. Game rules are described below: 
## Begin
Menu options including **New Game**, **Load Game** (Under construction), **Help Menu**, **Quit**. 
You can see the rules for the game in the **Help Menu** Option.
## Play
For a new game, you need to specify a random seed that is in the range of <font color='red'>JAVA LONG</font>. After that you'll be able to see the game interface. 
Win the game by found the brick and block the entrance of water, or lose if you spend to much time in 
the water and run out of air supply.
